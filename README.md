# Core Title Inheritance

# Version 1.0.5

## Credits
Mod creator: SurrealNumber
French Localization: Al3xell

## Description
This mod adds in a system to allow characters to retain more titles on succession under the partition succession laws. It achieves this goal by allowing them to designate titles as "core" which will cause them to be inherited by the character's heir. The user can optionally set a core title limit, add a cost to coring or holding core titles, or give core title counties a slight benefit.
